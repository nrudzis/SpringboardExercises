1. HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It provides rules of communication between the browser and web server.
2. URL stands for Universal Resource Locator. It includes the protocol (http, https, ftp, etc.), hostname (eg. google.com), port, resource (eg. web page), and query.
3. DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is like the phonebook for the internet. It translates the hostname into an IP address.
4. A query string is a part of the DNS that provides additional information for the resource, such as search terms, or information from a form.
5. Two HTTP verbs are GET and POST. A GET request doesn't have side-effects (doesn't change data on the server); a POST request has side-effects (changes data on server).
6. An HTTP request is a request-response protocol between a client and a server. It contains a method (GET, POST, etc.), http protocol version, resource URL, and headers.
7. HTTP headers enable the client and server to pass additional information in the HTTP request-response. For example, an Accept header is a request header indicating what kind of response is permitted. The Age header is a response header containing the time in seconds that the entry has been in the cache.
8. When a URL is entered into the browser:
  - the hostname is resolved into an IP address using DNS
  - the client browser makes a request to that IP, consisting of the request method, http protocol version, resource URL, and any headers
  - the server sends a response, consisting of the http protocol version, response status code (200, 404, etc.), response headers, and the response body
  - the client browser assembles the response body HTML into a DOM, and sends new requests for any additional resources such as CSS, Javascript, and images, and receives responses for each
